# Honeygain-Unofficial

A simple program that makes use of WebView2 to connect to Honeygain's website to show you what you've earned, etc. The default WebView component is not compatible with honeygain.com, which is why WebView2 was used instead when this software was created.

This software was created to compliment the Honeygain software already by Honeygain, available at <https://www.honeygain.com/>.

Development Environment: Visual Basic, VB, Visual Basic .NET, VB.NET, WebView2
